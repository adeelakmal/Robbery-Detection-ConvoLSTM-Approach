# Robbery Detection ConvoLSTM Approach
The following jupyter notebook is my first approach at trying to recognize robbery from CCTV footage using deep learning techniques. The methodolgy used in this project is the use of CNN and LSTM to perform Spatial and Temporal analysis to detect the action from three different types of activities namely Robbery, Road Accidents and Normal videos. The dataset used is the UCF crime dataset and the results of this attempt indicate 96% training accuracy and 73% test accuracy.
<h4>Frontend</h4>
The front end is built is Java and utilizes the JavaFX library to build the frontend and OpenCV to capture and render the frames these taska are done concurently by the help of multithreading and the frames are sent to a backend python based server where these frames are processed and the results are sent back so the frontend application updated itself accordingly
<h4>Updates</h4>
The latest iteration of the model uses VGG16 as a pre-trainer and builds upon the architecture using it to extract features and pass that to the LSTM cells. This approach proves to be significantly helpfull in avoiding overfitting which existed in the previous iteration of the model providing a training accuracy of 97% and an average validation accuracy of 86%.
